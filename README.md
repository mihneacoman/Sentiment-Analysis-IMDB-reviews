# Sentiment-Analysis-IMDB-reviews

Sentiment analysis on IMDB movie reviews using binary classification (positive vs. negative). Various classical ML algorithms were compared with a deep learning approach using transformers.

The project uses the dataset from:  

Maas, Andrew L., Daly, Raymond E., Pham, Peter T., Huang, Dan, Ng, Andrew Y., & Potts, Christopher. (2011). *Learning Word Vectors for Sentiment Analysis.* In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies.

The dataset is available at [Kaggle â€“ IMDB Sentiments](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jcblaise/imdb-sentiments).  

**Note:** The dataset must be saved in Google Drive and mounted in Google Colab to run the code.
